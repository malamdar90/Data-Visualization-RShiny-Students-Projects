# Students' Projects in the Data Visualization Course:

Johns Hopkins Carey Business School
Instructor: Dr. Mohammad Ali Alamdar Yazdi (yazdi@jhu.edu)
Tools: R Shiny

## Course Description:

This project-based course prepares students to make informed decisions based on data using descriptive-analytical techniques. Students will view examples from real-world business cases in which data visualization helps the decision makers to visualize, discover, and decode the hidden information from within the data, and to exploit such information for making educated decisions. We will use R to import, clean, transform, analyze, visualize, and present data. It is assumed that students have basic knowledge of programming in R prior to taking this class. As the course progresses, students will learn to work with libraries such as readr, tidyr, ggplot2, leaflet, and shiny in R. During the eight weeks of the course, students will collaborate with each other in small teams to analyze real-world datasets as well as design, build, and deliver web applications containing interactive visualizations and dashboards. Topics include cognition and visual perception, design principles, fundamental charts, interactive visualizations, storytelling in dashboards, and maps and big data visualization."
